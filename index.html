    Let's learn about Docker and why we're using it!
    Regardless of what you encounter in this lesson, the definitive guide is any 
    official documentation provided by <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>.
  </p>

    <h3 id="ops">What is Docker?</h3>

      <p><em>A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.</em></p>
     
      <p>In short, Docker allows a user to work in a computing environment that has been *frozen* with respect
      to interdependent libraries and code and related tools. This means that you can use the same software
      that analysts were using 10 years ago (for example) without downloading all the relevant 10-year-old
      libraries. :)</p>

      <h3 id="ops">What can I learn here?</h3>
      <p> As much as we'd like, we can't give you a *complete* overview of Docker. However, we do hope to explain
        why we run Docker in the way we do so that you gain some understanding. More specifically, we'll
        be showing you how to set up Docker for not just this workshop, but for interfacing with the 
        CMS open data in general</p>

        <h3 id="ops">Let's dive in!</h3>

      <p><em>Learn the core concepts of Docker, and help you understand the value of it. Key points are:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Docker is widely used these days in both industry and academic research</li>
        <li>Docker is one way that you can interface with CMS data using the same computing tools as CMS collaborators</li>
      </ul><br/>

      <p><em>Run the CMS open data workshop pre-exercises in this learning environment</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you did not get your local docker environment setup yet, you can run a selection of pre-exercises here to get you ready for the workshop</li>
        <li>Consider this as a back-up solution and remember that the sessions are not saved and your modifications will be lost.</li>
